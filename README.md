knowlEDGE is a cutting edge AI project aimed at improvising the current education system, which lacks one on one interaction.<br>
The project leverages the Falcon LLM's API for the interactive and personalised learning experience of the learners.<br>
We introduced 3 primary functionalities.<br>
<li><b>The Summariser</b>, which can summarise the content of any given pdf or text. </li>
<li><b>The Tutor</b>, this feature actively engages in the nourishment of the learners knowledge according to the level of knowledge the learner already has be it beginner, intermediate or advanced.</li> 
<li><b>The Homework bot</b>, this bot is specifically designed for the students who want to work and learn but are unable to work, the learner can pose questions to the LLM and seek help.</li>
